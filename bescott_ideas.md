Everyday:
- but during the Cold War
- Interesting visual language
- Compelling socioeconomic situation
- retro
- Some other time where something we cannot imagine would be a ritual, e.g., running from tanks, the berlin wall, action, etc

Switching:
- Static, spatially, can only occur in certain areas
- end-of-level goal
- self-sufficiency as a mechanic for the forest side

Practicing ritual to one's own downfall:
- A catholic priest trying to keep his rituals through the plague
- An aging man, trying to keep the rituals he had as a young man
- anyone, but after a cataclysm which invalidates their ritual

Ritual as compensation for loss:
- Elephants mourn over their dead young
- Parents grieving the loss of their child
- imaginary friend, after friend has died

Game Mechanic of Ritual:
- Users perform some action for the whole game
- must continue to press it after a great loss
- or after said action becomes meaningless
